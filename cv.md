## About myself 
Everyone has a dream so do i! I want to live good and full of self-development life with doing what I like.
From early age I always try to keep up with fast-growing trends. Now it effects on my career pass which i decided to choose - *web development*, potential full-stack development to be more specific.

## Skills 
I have basic knowledge of CS in general but I'm familiar with some programming languages. Here is the list of them:
* Python (basic knowledge)
* Java (basic knowledge)
* JavaScript (basic knowledge)
Here is some more technologies that I know:
* Git (basic knowledge)
* NPM modules
* Ubuntu shell (basic knowledge)
* HTML and CSS
* SASS

## Latest code examples
My latest solution on codewars for 6 kyu task called "Sort the Odd":
```javascript
function sortArrayIfOdd(array) {
    const odd = array.filter(el => el % 2).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return array.map(el => el % 2 ? odd.shift() : el)
}
```

## Experience
Didn't have any experience with commercial projects but did some stuff on my own. Mostly html and css projects. 
One of them i recently pushed on my GitHub "desktop ready" site (fully with no much commits because I finished it a while ago);
